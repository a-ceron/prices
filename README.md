IM-Analytics Qualification Test


As a Data Scientist you typically have to overcome multiple technical challenges related to data science itself, but at the same time, you must always take into consideration clients’ needs and translate them into quantitative hypotheses and solutions that can be communicated to a lay audience. This latter point is precisely what this test is all about. In this document you’ll find a problem described as a short story. During the challenge you will perform certain activities and produce some output. Specifically, we request you to please send us the following:

All the code. All the code you created to process and cleanse data, perform EDA, generate graphs, create statistical or machine-learning models, etc. Feel free to work in the programming language of your choice. Don’t forget to include comments stating your thought processes and ideas, even the ones that were not successful. Extra points will be given if you use some sort of shareable notebook in python!

A findings report. As a Data Scientist you always have to communicate your results to your peers, company, and/or clients. Please send us a presentation with your findings, so you can show your communication skills by building a report with a clear narrative, summarizing technical highlights and including conclusions. 


Rules and Expectations.

You have 72 hours to submit your output from the day and time you received this write-up.

We expect you to spend 3 to 4 hours cracking at the described problem.

Your output should be sent to recruiting@exploration.mx.


Output. You can send us your output as files attached in an email, as a link to a public repository (e.g., Github or Bitbucket), or as an online notebook.



The lapidarist problem

This problem is for you to:

Show your abilities in data loading, cleaning and descriptive analysis. Some rows contain errors. Extra points: clean these rows and include them in your analysis.

Show your modeling abilities. Bonus points for testing your model’s error using a test set.


The limousine comes to a full stop. As the driver gets out to open the door you take a deep breath and get inside. Inside the meeting room you find the Prime Minister, accompanied by a fat, tall man and a short, deform one with long ears and an even longer nose.

Prime Minister: “Ah! You’re here! Great! Let me introduce my guests. This is Fidelious, Minister of Magic, and Krenk, the owner of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank.”

You: “Uhhh, ma’am, is this a joke?”

Fidelious: “Not at all, but don’t worry, don’t sweat the details, tomorrow you won’t remember anything. Security measures, you see.”

Krenk: “Let’s move things along. I don’t like to be exposed to Muggles.”

You: “What...” The Prime Minister interrupts you.

Prime Minister: “Our friends here seem to have run into a bit of an issue, see, some diamonds seem to have been stolen from the bank. Problem is, the only person... goblin, sorry, ...who saw the diamonds prior to the robbery is our distinguished guest, Krenk.”

Fidelious: “And while the Ministry completely believes Krenk as to the diamonds’ worth, we need another person to validate his claim. Safety policies, you see.”

Prime Minister: “So, since you’re the best data scientist in our country, I thought you could help. Mr. Krenk will provide you with the characteristics of the missing diamonds so you can give us an estimate of how much the stolen diamonds are worth.”

You: “But I’m not a lapidarist.”

Prime Minister: “Which is why we’re providing you with a huge dataset, containing characteristics and prices for tens of thousands of diamonds. Now, get working.“

“Huge? Tens of thousands?“ You think. “And I thought I was the clueless one here.”
